# The Project

## Goals

FindYourGame is a web and mobile application that allows users to comment all the games found on the freetogame.com API. This tool must help decentralize social networking comments and have a new web vision through participatory sources or simply by adding a comment to federate communities around websites.  

Each comment will be shared by the entire FindYourGame user community. Our tool will make it possible to decentralize comments from social networks and to have a new vision of the web through participatory on sources (OSINT) or simply by adding a comment thus federating communities around websites.  

## Requirements

The client suggests some technical requirements that you can consider:  
• the API can be developed using the Laravel framework,  
• the front end can be developed in Vue.js,  
• a database could be an SQL one such as MariaDB or PostgreSQL,  
• there must be a secured authentication system.  
Your tasks are numerous and include:  
1. the setting up of a full-featured GitHub repository allowing your client/teacher to test and give you
regular feedback, and your team to publish frequent releases,  
2. the development and versioning of a minimum viable product, a working implementation of the main
features and the design.
